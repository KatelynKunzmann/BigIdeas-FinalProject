# Final Project - Best Neighborhood for a Triathlon ###
# Group: I forget.... it's Henry, Katelyn, and Samika's group (36) #
## Katelyn Kunzmann, Samika Sanghvi, Henry Wilson ##

We sought to look at three different Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center data sets to determine what the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh would be to hold a triathalon in.

Data metrics we are using:
* Sidewalk Walkability (Katelyn) - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/sidewalk-to-street-walkability-ratio
* Toxic Release Inventory of Waterways (Henry) - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/toxic-release-inventory
* Bike trails/lanes (Samika) - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/on-road-bicycle-pavement-markings

Samika - sps76@pitt.edu
Henry - how40@pitt.edu
